- 👋 Hi, I’m @finnbuck
- 👀 I’m interested in math, philosophy and history and the intersection of all these.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced git commands in the Pro Git manual.

<!---
finnbuck/finnbuck is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in Python or Java.
